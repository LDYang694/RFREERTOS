# RFREERTOS

FreeRTOS implemented in Rust





## Environment Prepare

##### Environment needed

- rust environment 
- Riscv toolchain
- qemu
- if you want to build Image run on D1ï¼Œdownload T-head Riscv toolchain in [occ.t-head.cn](https://occ.t-head.cn/community/download).

##### toolchain prepare

```shell
rustup install nightly
rustup default nightly
```

##### target install

```shell
rustup target add riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf
rustup target add riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf
rustup target add riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf
```



## Build

#### qemu

We provide `Makefile` to help quickly start build 

- if you want to build project that fit qemu-system-riscv32,set config in `./.cargo/config`

```
[build]
target = "riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf"
```

and run `make run32`

- else if you want to build project that fit qemu-system-riscv64,set config in`./.cargo/config`

```
[build]
target = "riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf"
```

and run `make run64` 

#### D1

if you want to build project that can run on the D1 board,please checkout to `master-64D1` branch

```
make build
```

and you can find `RFreeRTOS_Image` file. You can just load that image file run on the D1 board without any other helper process like `OpenSBI`.
